Process Recording Plugin
=========================

The purpose of this plugin is to perform post-processing of acquired electrophysiology data.

Required plugins
  * Sweeps

Target setting
---------------
Processing algorithm can be applied to all or a subset of the recording data.

Apply processing to the following sweeps
  Select between ``All sweeps``, ``Visible sweeps``, ``Highlighted sweeps``
  Processing algorithm will be applied to the corresponding sweeps.
  Visibility and highlight of sweeps can be changed in the ``Sweeps`` plugin
  and are only applicable in the ``overlay`` mode.

Limit process to the current channel
  Toggle this on to limit the scope of the algorithm to the current channel.
  Setting this option off will cause the processing to be applied to all channels.

Baseline Subtraction
-----------------------
Subtracts baseline from the sweeps.
For each sweep, a single value is applied to all the data points.
Different sweeps may have different baseline values, depending on the method.
This process cannot flatten drift within given sweep.

3 methods are available:

Mean of all targets
  For each sweep, a mean of all y-values is calculated as the baseline.
  Each sweep may have different baseline values.
  The corresponding baseline value is subtracted from all data points per sweep.

Mean of x-axis range
  For each sweep, a mean of y-values for data points within the specified x-axis
  are calculated as the baseline.
  Each sweep may have different baseline values.
  The corresponding baseline value is subtracted from all data points per sweep.
  Use this option if there is a clear x-axis range in each sweep that should be
  considered as the baseline

Fixed value
  A fixed value is subtracted from all data points in every sweep.

Apply button
  Perform baseline subtraction

Default button
  Sets all input parameters for baseline subtraction to default values

Average sweeps
---------------
Only available in ``overlay`` mode.
This process produces an 'average trace' based on the target sweeps.
All aligning y-values (at the same t) are averaged to produce an average data point.

A new sweep representing the average trace is appended to the recording.

This process assumes that the recording was performed at constant sampling rate.

Hide original sweeps
  Checking this option will result in the original sweeps being hidden
  and only the new average trace being visible after the processing is completed.

Apply button
  Apply the average sweeps process

Default button
  Sets the ``Hide original sweeps`` option on.


Filtering
------------

``Proccess Recording`` plugin currently offers the following filtering options:

* Lowpass Boxcar
* Lowpass Bessel

More filtering options may be added based on demand.

Selecting the filtering algorithm makes widgets for required parameters visible.

Apply button
  Apply the filter to the sweeps

Default button
  Sets all input parameters to default values
