to navigate the trace plot.

Set axes limits
-----------------
Lower and upper limits of the x- and y- axes can be inputted into the
corresponding areas.

Get buttons
  For each x- and y- axes, the ``Get`` button fills the form with the
  values from the current axis limits.
  The ``Get current`` button fills the information for both the x- and the y-axes.

  'auto' can be written to allow the software to automatically determine the
  lower and/or upper bounds.

Force axis limits on open
  Check the box to set the x- and y-axes limits when a new recording file is opened.
  Useful if there is a consistent range of the data points that should be
  excluded from analysis.

Apply button
  Enforces the axes limits as indicated in the form.

Default button
  Returns the axes limit inputs to default values ('auto')

Show all button
  Press this button to make the entire recording data fit in the visible axes.
  The same effect can be achieved by pressing the :guilabel:`Home` key.

The rest of the parameters alter how the navigation tools behave.
