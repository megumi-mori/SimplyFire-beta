======================

The purpose of this plugin is to facilitate analysis of evoked release.

  A typical layout of the Evoked Analysis Plugin.

Requirements:
  * :doc:`sweeps`
  
Tab title: Evoked

Target setting
---------------
Processing algorithm can be applied to all or a subset of the recording data.

Apply processing to the following sweeps
  Select between ``All sweeps``, ``Visible sweeps``, ``Highlighted sweeps``
  Processing algorithm will be applied to the corresponding sweeps.
  Visibility and highlight of sweeps can be changed in the :doc:`sweeps`
  and are only applicable in the ``overlay`` mode.

Limit process to the current channel
  Toggle this on to limit the scope of the algorithm to the current channel.
  Setting this option off will cause the processing to be applied to all channels.


Limit x-axis for analysis to
  Select between ``Entire sweep``, ``Visible window``, ``Defined range``.
  Processing algorithm will be applied to the specified x-axis limits.

Min/Max
--------
This section calculates the minimum and maximum values per sweep.
It is recommended to perform baseline subtraction prior to Min/Max calculation
if the goal of the analysis is to extract the amplitude of the synaptic
activity in each sweep.

Calculate Min/Max
  Extracts the minimum and maximum value per sweep within the specified x-axis
  limits.
  Results are listed in the data-panel located below the trace plot.


Buttons
--------
Report stats
  Reports the summary of entries in the data-panel to the **results-table**.
  Average and standard deviation of the minimum and maximum values are calculated.
  Note that all entries are summarized into a single entry.

Delete all
  Clears all entries in the data-panel.


Data-panel
-----------
Results from the calculations are entered into the data-panel.

New data are appended to existing entries unless a new recording file is opened.
The data are cleared when a new file is opened.

An entry can be selected by :guilabel:`left click`

Multiple entries can be selected by :guilabel:`left click + Shift`
or :guilabel:`left click + Ctrl`.

Pressing :guilabel:`Delete`/:guilabel:`Backspace`/:guilabel:`e` deletes
the entries in the data-panel and associated mini markers on the trace.
