Mini Analysis Plugin
=====================

The purpose of this plugin is to detect, analyze, and annotate mini
synaptic events.

Core Parameters
---------------------

Direction
  Indicates the expected sign of the minis.
  Typically, the direction is positive for potential and negative for current
  recordings.

Search radius in % of the visible x-axis (Manual)
  Used for manual mini analysis. Indicates the x-axis radius that is considered
  for analysis when the mouse is clicked. The radius is represented as a percentage
  of the total x-axis.
  In general, the lower number in this parameter, the higher the precision
  of the mouse-click.

Search window in ms (Auto)
  Used for automated mini analysis.
  Indicates the window of x-axis that is considered at a time.
  The window traverses from left to right, sampling the specified window at a
  time.
  In general, the lower number in this parameter, the fewer minis are skipped
  but also the slower the analysis.


  .. Caution::

    The x-axis window considered for each mini analysis must be larger than
    at least of 20 data points worth of x-axis range
    (i.e. for a 10kHz recording, the window must be larger
    than 2ms)
    Ideally, each mini analysis covers at least the approximate width of a
    single mini event.

Window before peak to estimate baseline (ms)
  The baseline is calculated by averaging data points.
  Setting this value >0 fixes where the data points are sampled
  in relation to the peak time to
  calculate the baseline.
  The value specifies the left most (earliest) data point to sample for
  baseline calculation.

  Set this parameter to 0 to ignore the parameter and use the
  trailing-moving-average.

Window averaged to find start of mini (ms)
  The baseline is calculated by averaging data points.
  This parameter sets the size of the x-axis window that should be
  sampled to calculate the average.
  Higher numbers tend to result in increased robustness against consistent
  baseline noise;
  however, higher numbers can result in effects of unusually large and rapid
  deviations from the baseline (i.e. artefacts) affecting the surrounding
  mini baseline calculations.

Use decay to extrapolate halfwidth
  If a mini does not decay below 50% of the amplitude, halfwidth cannot
  be calculated. Checking this option allows SimplyFire to estimate
  the halfwidth using the decay properties.

Decay calculation method
  Two algorithms are available to estimate the decay constant (tau):
  ``Curve fit`` or ``% amplitude``
  ``Curve fit`` uses the ``scipy`` package to fit a single exponential to
  the raw data.
  ``% amplitude`` uses the first data point that reaches a certain percentage of the
  maximum amplitude after the peak to estimate the decay constant.

Starting seed for exponential decay fit (ms)
  Input available for ``Curve fit`` algorithm.
  Enter the 'best guess' for the decay constant when fitting a single exponential
  to the decay phase of the mini. This parameter is passed to the
  `scipy.optimize.curve_fit <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html>`_
  function.

Percent peak to mark as decay constant (%)
  Input available for ``% amplitude`` algorithm.
  Enter the percentage value used to estimate the decay constant.
  Enter 37 to estimate the decay constant for a single exponential function.

Maximum x-interval considered for decay (ms)
  Input available for ``Curve fit`` and ``% amplitude`` algorithms.
  Enter the maximum range of data points that should be sampled to calculate the
  decay constant.

Analyze compound minis
  Select this checkbox to analyze compound minis

Minimum valley size in % of peak amplitude
  Input available if analyzing compound minis.
  Enter a percentage of the maximum amplitude that must be reached during the
  decay phase before the next mini.

Maximum interval between two peaks to use compound mini analysis (ms)
  Input available if analyzing compound minis.
  Enter the maximum range between two minis that should use compound mini analysis.

Ignore minis closer than (ms)
  Input available if analyzing compound minis.
  Enter the radius around the peak that should be ignored while
  searching for compound minis.
  Increase this value if the automated analysis is picking up noise around
  the peak.

Apply button
  Apply the parameters for future analysis.

Default button
  Sets the core input parameters to default values.

Filtering parameters
----------------------

Minimum and maximum values can be set for the following parameters.
Setting these values before analyzing minis will reject any candidate
minis that do not meet the parameters.
Previously found minis can be filtered by setting the parameters and clicking
on ``Apply filter (all)`` or ``Apply filter (window)``.

Minimum values set to 0 and maximum values set to ``None`` will be ignored.


amplitude (absolute value)
  Specify the minimum/maximum amplitude required for a mini.
  Use absolute value (unsigned).
  Setting this to 0 (without other filtering parameters) will result in
  most noise being annotated as a mini.

decay constant (tau) (ms)
  Specify the minimum/maximum decay constant required for a mini in ms.

halfwidth (ms)
  Specify the minimum/maximum halfwidth required for a mini in ms.
  Halfwidth is calculated as the minimum time between data points at 50% of the
  maximum amplitude during the rise and decay phases.

rise constant (ms)
  Specify the minimum/maximum rise time required for a mini in ms.
  Rise is calculated from the start of the mini (0% amplitude) and
  the peak (100% amplitude).

decay/rise ratio
  Specify the minimum/maximum ratio between decay and rise for a mini.

signal-to-noise ratio
  Specify the minimum/maximum ratio between baseline noise standard deviation
  and the maximum amplitude or the mini.
  Baseline noise is defined as the standard deviation of the data points
  sampled in estimating the baseline.

Confirm button
  Sets the filtering parameters for future analysis.
  This does not affect previously found minis.

Default
  Sets the filtering parameters to default values.
  This does not affect previously found minis.

Apply filter (all) button
  Applies the filtering parameters to all previously found minis.
  Any minis that do not meet the criteria are discarded.

Apply filter (window)
  Applies the filtering parameters to previously found minis in the visible
  x-axis.
  Any minis within the visible x-axis that do not meet the criteria are discarded.


Data-panel display columns
----------------------------
Toggle the checkboxes to change the visibility of columns in the
data-panel.

Show all button
  Sets all columns in the data-panel to 'show'.

Hide all button
  Hides all columns in the data-panel.


Style setting
--------------
The markers on the plot for minis can be altered in the ``Style`` Plugin
**control-panel**.

The size and color of the following markers can be changed.
Size should be an integer.
Color should be a hex code or a color name accepted by ``matplotlib``.
See the `matplotlib documentation <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html>`_
for more details on supported color names.

Peak
  Marks the data point in the mini with the maximum amplitude as a dot.

Start
  Marks the data point at the start of the mini with 'x'.

Decay
  Marks where t=decay constant with 'x'.
  Depending on the decay algorithm chosen, the point may or may not be
  an actual data point in the recording.

Highlight
  Marks only the selected minis with a dot.
  Minis can be selected by clicking on existing peak markers or by
  :guilabel:`left-click`+:guilabel:`drag`. 

Apply button
  Apply the stylistic parameters

Default button
  Sets the input parameters to default values

Mini guide
------------
Sometimes it can be unclear why a mini was chosen or why the parameters
look different from what was expected.
The **mini guide** attempts to clear such questions by providing a detailed
report of a given mini.

Click the ``Open guide`` button to open a popup.
Triggering a manual analysis or selecting a single mini will plot the
same mini in the popup window.

.. figure:: /_static/img/mini_guide.png
  :align: center

  An example mEJC shown in the **mini guide**

In the plot area, the following details are plotted:
  * Raw data points including and around the mini
  * The data point representing the start of mini
  * The data point representing the peak
  * Data points sampled to calculate the baseline
  * Single exponential decay function fitted to the decay phase
  * A point within the decay function where t = decay constant
  * A line plotting the baseline (a single y-value for a regular mini,
    extrapolated decay from previous mini for compound minis)
  * A line representing the amplitude
  * A line connecting the two data points used to calculate the halfwidth


In the text box below the plot, the following details can be found:
  * Whether or not there was a mini in the region
  * Peak data point
  * Baseline value
  * x-axis limits used to calculate the baseline
  * Amplitude
  * Rise constant (0-100)
  * Decay (tau)
  * Decay/rise ratio
  * Halfwidth
  * Signal-to-noise ratio

  .. Tip::
    If no mini is discovered with manual analysis,
    the reason for the failure will be available in the text box.
    Adjusting the parameters or easing the filtering criteria may help
    detect the mini

Remove Restrictions button
  Clicking this button when a manual analysis fails to detect a mini
  re-analyzes the region but without any of the filtering parameters.

Reanalyze button
  Clicking this button when a manual analysis fails to detect a mini
  re-analyzes the region with the parameters set in the **control-panel**.
  Use this button to reanalyze minis after changing parameters.

Reject button
  Clicking this button when a mini is highlighted discards the mini
  from the data.
