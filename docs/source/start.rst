Installation
--------------

.exe Installation for Windows (simple)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the software zip file from the latest github repository.

`Download SimplyFire zip <https://github.com/megumi-mori/SimplyFire-beta/releases/download/v0.3.0-beta/SimplyFire0.3.0.zip>`_.

Extract the contents of the zip file.
Within the ``SimplyFire`` root folder, locate ``SimplyFire.exe``.
Run the executable file to begin the application.

That's it!

Supported systems:

* Windows 10


Python Installation (advanced)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SimplyFire can be installed as a Python module through PyPI.

Install SimplyFire from `TestPyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/SimplyFire/>`_ using
`pip` as follows:

.. code:: console

  $ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ simplyfirebeta


The package will be made available on the main PyPI database in the future for stable releases.

Once installed, run SimplyFire from any directory:

.. code:: console

  $ py -m simplyfire

SimplyFire is mainly a GUI-based software.
However, the algorithms for analyses can be imported as packages and used in Python scripts.

Required Packages:

SimplyFire is dependent on the following packages (with tested version numbers):

* `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ (>=1.21.5)
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ (>=3.5.1)
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ (>=1.3.5)
* `scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_ (>=1.7.3)
* `pyyaml <https://pyyaml.org/>`_ (>=6.0)
* `pyabf <https://swharden.com/pyabf/>`_ (>=2.3.5)

Earlier packages have not been tested, but they may still work.

Supported Systems:

The code has been developed on Windows 10.

While most of the code should work on any platform,
some of the GUI event-handling and file read/write may be system specific.

OSX and Linux testers are welcome to submit system-specific issues!

Source Code (developer)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SimplyFire is entirely written in Python.

The source code can be found in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/megumi-mori/SimplyFire-beta>`_

Algorithm specific to a plugin are stored as separate submodules.
These modules do not require the GUI component, and may be imported independently of the GUI application.


Supported Systems:

The code has been developed on Windows 10.

The GUI component may have system-specific code.
The analysis modules should work independently of the system environment.

System-specific issues are welcome!

Using the software
---------------------

GUI Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon startup, the software will look like this:

.. figure:: /_static/img/main_annotated.png
  :align: center

  Default layout of the software.

control-panel
  Most plugins use this area to display buttons and parameter inputs.
  Multiple plugins can be opened at the same time, and they are
  displayed as separate tabs in the panel.

trace-display
  This area handles plotting of the recording data.
  Navigation tools are located around the plot.

data-panel
  Plugins for analysis will have a unique table that show up in this area
  to display the data.

.. figure:: /_static/img/log.png
  :align: center

  Log-display

log-display
  Can be reached by selecting the ``log`` tab beneath the **trace-display**.
  A log of activity while using the software can be found here.
  User annotations can also be added to the log.
  The details of the log can be saved in to a text file.


.. figure:: /_static/img/results.png
  :align: center

  Results-display

results-display
  Summary of data from analyses may be entered here by various plugins.
  Typically, average and standard deviations of the data are reported. 

.. _open-recording:

Open a recording
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SimplyFire can read files stored in ``.abf`` format.
Other file formats are currently not supported, but feature requests
are always welcome.


To open a new file, go to ``File`` menu -> ``Open Recording`` or press ``Alt+o``.

Recording data from a single channel will be plotted on the ``graph-panel``.

Change the channel displayed through the ``channel`` drop-down menu located
above the plot.

.. Tip::

  If the same channel is always analyzed, the channel selection process
  can be skipped by checking the ``Always open the same channel`` check box
  located above the plot. Enter the index of the channel to be accessed.
  The channels are numbered starting from 0 ('0-indexing').

A recording can be shown in **continuous** mode or **overlay** mode.
To change the display mode, go to the ``View`` menu and select the desired mode.

continuous
  the recording is shown as a single trace.
  Each subsequent sweep is concatenated after the last.
  Mini analysis mode requires the recording to be in this mode.

overlay
  multiple sweeps are superimposed

.. _navigation-tools:

Navigation Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Navigate the recording data by using the navigation buttons located around
the plot.
Both x- and y- axes have buttons to zoom in/out and pan.
The y-axis scrollbar controls the position of the left-most visible datapoint
in the y-axis.
The x-axis scrollbar controls the visible x-axis window relative to the
entire recording.

The following keyboard shortcuts are available to navigate the plot:

``w``/``a``/``s``/``d`` keys
  Pan the x- and y-axes

``i``/``j``/``k``/``l`` keys
  Zoom the x- and y-axes

Several ``matplotlib`` tools are available above the plot for navigation.

.. |ico_pan| image:: /_static/img/move.png

|ico_pan| pan/zoom
  Left click and drag to move the trace.
  Right click and drag to zoom the axes

.. |ico_zoom| image:: /_static/img/zoom_to_rect.png

|ico_zoom| zoom to rect
  Click and drag to draw a rectangle.
  Left click and drag to zoom in.
  Right click and drag to zoom out.

.. |ico_save| image:: /_static/img/filesave.png

|ico_save| save figure
  Saves the visible plot as an image file.
  Everything that is visible on the plot, including
  markers from plugins will be saved.
  Vector image file format is available for making figures for publication.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^^

Other navigation, data-processing, and analysis options
are available via various plugins.

All GUI-based plugins are hidden by default.
To make them visible, go to ``Plug-ins`` menu -> click on the
desired plugin name.
Plugins that require user-input will typically have a form appear
in the **control-panel**, located on the left-hand side of the application.

Use the tabs in the **control-panel** to navigate between various plugins.


Check out the :doc:`workflow` section for primers on analysis methods.
Check out the :doc:`plugins_gui` section for details on each plugin.


Plugins
^^^^^^^^
Plugins can be turned off/on.
By default, all of the plugins in the package are turned on.
To control which plugins are in use, go to ``Plug-ins`` menu -> ``Manage plug-ins``.

Toggle the check box for each plugin and click on ``Apply``.

Restart the software to reflect the changes.

Custom and external plugins can be added to the ``plugins`` folder located within the software data directory.
